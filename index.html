        <h2 style="font-family: Canterbury, Old English Text serif;font-size: 25px;">💌 Happy Birthday, My Love!</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Canterbury, Old English Text serif;font-size: 19px;">I woke up this morning with the biggest smile, knowing today is all about celebrating you! My beautiful Papita, I’ve been counting down the days until I could celebrate the person who makes life so incredibly joyful. The very first thought I had was just pure excitement for the year ahead and all the wonderful things we're going to experience. Today is just the beginning of your best year yet.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Canterbury, Old English Text serif;font-size: 19px;">There are so many things I adore about you, but it’s the small, everyday details that truly melt my heart.
        First, I absolutely adore your beautiful, melodic voice. Whether you’re singing terribly in the car or just recounting your day, hearing you speak is my favorite sound in the world.
        And speaking of routines, I love your unstoppable commitment to happiness, best demonstrated by your cute habit of always needing ice cream after every single time we eat. It’s the perfect, sweet end to every meal, just like you are to my day.
        The most reliable comfort in my life is that moment every evening when you tell me all about your day. It instantly changes my mood, washing away any stress and filling the space with your perspective. You are my calm, my center, and my favorite storyteller.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Canterbury, Old English Text serif;font-size: 19px;">I’ll never forget that night when we were laughing and sharing stories. I was already completely smitten, just by talking to you, how you make me blush with every compliment you give me.
        how you make me feel that joyful embarrassment, nobody ever could make me feel like that.Every year with you gets better, and I can't wait to continue building our life together.More than that, I look forward to the big picture: getting old and grumpy together! Building a life where we always feel safe, supported, and loved, no matter what happens. You are my anchor, my favorite adventure partner, and the essential piece of my future.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Canterbury, Old English Text serif;font-size: 19px;">Thank you for being the most thoughtful, sweetest, and most beautiful person I know. I hope your day is just as spectacular as you are.</p>


        <p style="font-family: Canterbury, Old English Text serif;font-size: 19px;">I love you more than words can say.</p>

        <p style="font-family:'Dancing Script', cursive;font-size: 22px;">Happy Birthday, Papita!</p>
